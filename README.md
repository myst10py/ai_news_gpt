# ai_news_gpt

Only started with frontend to mimic different site sections, each with posts to be updated with AI derived content/posts.

Need to implement backend that actually does the AI logic to generate the content for each site we are interested in
for trusted, higher quality sources with higher probability of signal to learn from and reference.
